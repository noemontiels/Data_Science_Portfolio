## Analysis of labour market supply and demand in the data environment: Global wages and conditions <a name="id1"></a>

This project focuses on labour market analysis in the data sector. The aim is to identify trends in labour supply and demand, compare wages and assess global labour conditions.

Data on job vacancies and salaries in the data sector were collected and cleaned. Descriptive analyses and visualisations were conducted to identify global and regional trends and patterns.

## Data-Driven Real Estate: Classifying properties based on investment potential <a name="id2"></a>

This project focuses on leveraging Machine Learning to classify real estate properties based on their Return on Investment (ROI). The aim is to assist investors in identifying high-potential opportunities, optimizing portfolios, and minimizing risks.

Data on property prices, sizes, locations, and amenities were collected, cleaned, and analyzed. A predictive model was developed using Logistic Regression to classify properties into three categories: Highly Profitable, Somewhat Profitable, and Not Profitable. Descriptive analyses and visualizations highlighted key trends and patterns in the real estate market.
